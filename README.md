# i-Comic
Django based web app to enable registered users to define custom comic strips, request new features and report bugs. Also includes a user forum for general discussion, productivity charts to indicate developer work rates and finally  documentation for developers who wish to contribute.

## Technical approach
The app was developed using web framework **Django** alongside **Python**, using its Model-View-Template structure. Productivity charts are visualised using JavaScript libraries **Chartist.js** and **moment.js**. Dynamic front end elements were implemented using **jQuery**. For device responsiveness **Bootstrap** is employed.

## Features
- _Custom Comic Strip_: Users can define their own personal comic strips by adding self authored images and narrative
- _Tickets_: Raise requests for new features or raise bugs. Upvote to speed up the development of a solution and comment on individual tickets
- _Forum_: Users can raise their own topics for discussion and discuss each topic at leisure
- _Productivity_: Gain an overall insight in to productivity via charts showing tickets raised over time

## Site Design

### Colour Scheme
A five colour palette was generated using [colormind.io](colormind.io) to ensure proper colour coordination. Full details in [palette.txt](palette.txt)

### Typography
Google Fonts: "Permanent Marker" (major headings), "Kalam" (sub headings and buttons), "Arsenal" (body text).
Cursive heading fonts used to reflect a comic book style.

### Wireframe Mockup
Mockup constructed using [WireframePro](https://mockflow.com/apps/wireframepro/) Version 3.0.9. see [wireframe.pdf](wireframe.pdf)
